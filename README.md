# Keith Taylor Authoring Website Source

[.github/`add new screenshot`]

All about Keith's:

- Sites owned
- Sites contributed to
- Social networks
- Public Profile Pages
- Archived content
- Any other Internet content
- Writing tools I use or have used
- Authoring tools I use or have used

I include tags. Especially `Contact` so you can easily see details of different ways to contact me. Including a summary page of the main ways to make contact.

This project is built mostly edited with [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

## How to collaborate on content

- Just start a [New Issue](./issues/new/choose)

## Develop

- I anticipate website users will contribute by commenting on, or adding new issues.
- I hope Jamstack and GitHub developers will guide me however they can. Because I have lots to learn about most aspects of using this model as I transmigrate from WordPress.

## Credits

I could not have got this far without the wonderful gift of [Site In A Box (SIAB) from Shane Robinson](https://github.com/11ta/11ta-template).

## ToDo

- Move technical development to a duplicated template repo and refocus this on improving content for Keith Taylor
- resolve dependency issues. Note 220329, started trying to address some errors using Gitpod Terminal. Specifically `npx browserslist@latest` --update-db and `npm audit fix --force`
