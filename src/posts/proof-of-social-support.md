<p>This is something of a test post to prove that integrating Web3 social chat into a Web2 site can provide the potential for a new social support environment. Leading to a range of support styles. From corporate "giffgaff" style structured customer service. To free flow "amateur" style ad-hoc user support.</p>
<p>[So maybe title should be Proof Of Social Support]</p>
<h2 id="endlesspossibilities">Endless POSSibilities</h2>
<p>My vision is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group of like-minded people who get the giffgaff concept and are excited about its potential on Web3</li>
<li>Pro packages that companies can buy with a range of features</li>
<li>Self-served packages that people or organizations can customize for their own needs</li>
<li>A working example of each type of community that can develop and market new packages according to real-life experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>So anyone could earn money from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting fellow fans of their favourite products/services</li>
<li>Add Social Support to their own website</li>
<li>Provide paid Social Support as an Agent, Moderator, or Manager </li>
</ul>
<p>With the first two opportunities available now. And the paid opportunities available as the market is established.
