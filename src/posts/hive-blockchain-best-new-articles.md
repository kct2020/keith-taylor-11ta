<p>This Hive Blockchain new content report is one of several progress reports as I <a href="https://shrewdies.net/moving-towards-web3-monetization/">move towards Web3 monetization</a>.</p>
<p>Before I explain more about my Hive Blockchain articles, let me give credit to Canva for the image I've chosen to illustrate this article. Which is my choice from the 4 images generated by Canva from my prompt: <code>A group of writers eagerly anticipating the best new articles about monetizing content on the Hive blockchain</code>.</p>
<h2 id="subject">Hive Blockchain Subject</h2>
<p>Everything that I add to <a href="https://shrewdies.com/">Shrewdies3</a> is <em>from</em> the Hive Blockchain. But these articles are <strong>about</strong> the Hive Blockchain. Including what it is, its history, and its future possibilities. Also, how to harness its benefits. While avoiding its drawbacks.</p>
<p>The list below is my summaries of Hive Blockchain articles that were originally written for rewards from the Hive Rewards Week. But they have interest beyond 7 days. Often being enjoyed by readers for many months and years. So I promote them for rewards in the <a href="https://shrewdies.com/post/keithtaylor/actifit-keithtaylor-20240104t003213996z">Hive Afterweek</a>.</p>
<h2 id="content">New Hive Blockchain Content</h2>
<p>As I find new Hive blockchain content, I add it to <a href="https://hypothes.is/users/keithtaylor?q=tag%3AWeb3" target="_blank">Keith Taylor's Hive Blockchain Discovery Channel.</a> In fact, I tag all my Hive platform discoveries with the Hive Blockchain tag. Because they are all Hive blockchain-related. But to differentiate those that are mainly about the blockchain, I tag them with the <code>Web3</code> tag. So here are my latest discoveries…</p>

<h2 id="monetization">Hive Blockchain Promotion &amp; Monetization</h2>
<p>I generate the list above as I identify articles that have proven to be of continuing interest. At which time, those notes become the first step in promoting evergreen Hive Blockchain content to Hypothesis users.</p>
<p>Next, I incorporate some of those notes into the Hive Blockchain content pages on Shrewdies3. Pushing further promotion through search engines. Which, in turn, improves monetization from increased website traffic. So I mark this progress by adding a link to the Shrewdies3 page.</p>

<h2 id="next">Hive Blockchain: Next Steps</h2>
<p>I've explained how I begin my promotion process as a basis for monetizing Hive Blockchain content. Next, I monitor uptake by search engines. Then refine my presentation accordingly. Including the addition of updates, comments, and links to related pages. </p>
<p>Of course, if you write your own content on Hive, you can manage those refinements directly in your own posts. In which case, I can help you with some traffic analytics that drive those content refinements.</p>
<p><em>Have you identified evergreen Hive Blockchain content?</em></p>
<p>Then work with me to promote and monetize it. So that you can benefit from long-term rewards in the Hive Afterweek.
