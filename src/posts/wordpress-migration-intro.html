<h2 id="intro">Introducing WordPress Transmigration</h2>

I've planned to move some websites from WordPress to static sites for a long time. Recently, I've started the actual transfer process. Along the way, I introduced 'WordPress Transmigration' as my term for this process. So, here's a summary of (some of) the story so far...

<h2 id="key1">What is Transmigration?</h2>

I've been considering switching some of my websites from WordPress for quite a while. Mainly because it's becoming too cumbersome for my needs. But that does not mean that I have discarded WordPress entirely.

I explained that in my Introduction to After WordPress on Netlify. Now you can see that it has taken 2 years to move forward to what I now call WordPress Transmigration.

Along the way, it has been difficult to find information that is truly focussed on practical ways to change deploymewnt platforms from WordPress to static sites. Probably because there is no established name for the procedure.

Especially troublesome terms include 'Ã¨xporting' and 'migration'. Because I've found that searching for these terms give lots of articles. But most are concerned with moving from one WordPress installation to a new server. And even when I focus on 'static site' with 'WordPress' searches I rarely see results that explain the whole process.

So while I was trying to find better search terms, my thesaurus mentioned 'transmigration'. Unfortunately, the term has some dodgy connotations. But the best definitions I found came when comparing migration and transmigration. Then it became clear that 'migration' relates to a temporary resettlement such as birds in winter. Whereas 'transmigration' is "Departure from one's native land to settle in another"

As such, that infers good planning, preparation, and performance. Followed by an adjustment period where adopting new customs and language are vital. So I intend to explain all those stages on PROSPRA and on Shrewdies, as appropriate.

<h2 id="key2">Leading WordPress Transmigration Experts</h2>

During development of my WordPress Transmigration procedures I adopted the term gradually. However, I never checked if it was a term in common use. Probably because I realized that my way of evolving website content is different. But I'll cover that elsewhere.

This morning, I decided to search for specific "WordPress Transmigration". So I was'nt surprised to find only 8 results. But  I was delighted to find my PROSPRA project at the top of the results.

I've reformatted the top 7 results to fit the screenshot below. Unfortunately, I couldn't find an easy way to fit the 8th result. However, it is a rogue result from some spammy list that includes an accidental collision of 'WordPress' with 'Transmigration'.

Of the 7 results shown:
- I'm #1!
- #2-4 seem related. So, I'll be researching that Tumblr project and reporting back later.
- #5-7 are GitHub results that I will investigate soon.

During my investigations, I'll be looking for potential collaborations. But irrespective of that, I'll develop my own WordPress Transmigration expertise. Then passing on my knowledge with explanations, templates, and plans.

<h2 id="summary">WordPress Transmigration Summary</h2>

I may consider offering a paid WordPress Transmigration service. But my main focus is to document the procedures so that people can do it themselves.

Ideally, I can collaborate with other WordPress Transmigration experts. Then we can cover more use cases. Also, I'm unlikely to consider paid services without the support of a like-minded team.
