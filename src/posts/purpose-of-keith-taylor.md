<h2 id="next">Your Purpose for Shrewdies.net</h2>

I've explained why Shrewdies.net exists. And why you should use it to find information that interests you. So now it's time for you to think carefully about why you are here.

For example, you might just want to find out more about Keith Taylor. Or you might have an issue that you want to get help for.

In the first case, continue to browse these 'About' pages. Then browse facts, examples, and articles. Starting from the Home Page. Or search for topics that interest you using links at the top and bottom of every page.

In the second case, I hope that you might consider <a href="https://prospra.com/">starting a PROSPRA project</a>. But I still have lots to do to make that site an easy-to-use tool. So for now, I recommend that you start discussing your issue(s) on the <a href="https://github.com/kct2020/keith-taylor-11ta/issues">Keith Taylor's Internet Content Issues Page</a>.
