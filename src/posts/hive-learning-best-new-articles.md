<p>This is one of my progress reports for <a href="https://shrewdies.net/moving-towards-web3-monetization/">new articles that I'm monetizing on Web3</a>. Specifically, this report shows my progress in promoting Evergreen Hive content about learning.</p>
<p>Before I explain more about my Hive Learning articles, let me give credit to Canva for the image I've chosen to illustrate this article. Which is my choice from the 4 images generated by Canva from my prompt:<code>A group of learners eagerly anticipating the best new articles about learning from the Hive blockchain</code>.</p>
<h2 id="subject">Hive Learning Subject</h2>
<p>Learning is the main topic that I selected to start promoting on <a href="https://shrewdies.com/">Shrewdies3</a>. Because it supports the Shrewd Learning ethos of learning about subjects that interest you. Then applying your new knowledge to earn income. However, Hive enables us to earn while we are learning. So I'll be exploring Learn2Earn in greater depth after I complete my launch of Shrewdies3. At which time, I'll clarify the differences between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hive Rewards from blockchain curation during the first 7 days from the publication of your learning post.</li>
<li>Shrewdies3 Rewards from monetization in the <a href="https://shrewdies.com/post/keithtaylor/actifit-keithtaylor-20240104t003213996z">Hive Afterweek</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For my upcoming Shrewdies3 launch, I'm refining my workflows to ensure that I can cope with high volumes of new content. Part of which is this progress report covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discoveries of meaningful Hive content about learning.</li>
<li>Notification of my promotion of that evergreen content for learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>For notification of my promotion and monetization of each article, I simply add a link to the article on Shrewdies3, in the list above.</p>

<h2 id="next">Hive Learning: Next Steps</h2>
<p>I've explained how I begin my promotion process as a basis for monetizing Hive Learning content. Next, I monitor uptake by search engines. Then refine my presentation accordingly. Including the addition of updates, comments, and links to other pages. Of course, if you write your own content on Hive, you can manage those refinements directly in your post. In which case, I can help you with some traffic analytics that drive those content refinements.
