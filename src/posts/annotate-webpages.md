<p>I'm blogging about how I'm using Hypothes.is as a starting point for documentation about ðŸ“’ShrewdNotes Web Page Annotation. Because I'm learning how to organize efficient workflows with ðŸ“’ShrewdNotes. Then I can be certain that my documentation is accurate for when I get more people involved.</p>
<p>So these are practical notes that guide me. In order to become reference material for anonymous learners, followers, subscribers, and members. Also, these notes can become a framework for Hypothes.is-style ðŸ“’ShrewdNotes that I can adapt for Sciwheel and other annotation services.</p>

<h2 id="hypothesisgroupsandtags">Hypothes.is Groups and Tags</h2>
<p>I use Hypothes.is Groups as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Group for Anonymous Learners.</li>
<li>ðŸ—ƒShrewdSubjects Groups.</li>
<li>My Private Group.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="publicgroupforanonymouslearners">Public Group for Anonymous Learners</h3>
<p>I make most of my Hypothes.is ðŸ“’ShrewdNotes in public. Mainly on my own websites. But increasingly whenever I find anything useful or interesting. Especially where I find good content relating to one of my ðŸ—ƒShrewdSubjects. So anyone can follow my <a href="https://hypothes.is/groups/__world__/public?q=user%3AKeithTaylor" target="_blank">Public ðŸ“’ShrewdNotes</a>.</p>
<p>To recognize ðŸ—ƒShrewdSubjects, I use Hypothes.is Tags. Currently, these are <a href="https://hypothes.is/search?q=tag%3AFood" target="_blank">Food</a>, <a href="https://hypothes.is/search?q=tag%3AGout" target="_blank">Gout</a>, and <a href="https://hypothes.is/search?q=tag%3ALearning" target="_blank">Learning</a>. Where Learning includes any topic not covered by the other subjects. In this way, as I recognize new subjects, I will separate them from Shrewd Learning.</p>
<p>Note that Public annotations for my subject tags include notes from all Hypothes.is users. So, tags are a great way to collect notes by everyone who is interested in a topic. Also, you can mix and match User, Group, and Tag searches. As well as using free-format search.</p>
<p>Additionally, I've started using Hypothes.is Tags to help me organize my workflows. Currently, I use 4, but I may extend this as I incorporate annotation into my daily life. My current 4 tags are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hypothes.is/users/KeithTaylor?q=tag%3ANew" target="_blank">New</a> - denotes new content that I'm preparing.</li>
<li><a href="https://hypothes.is/users/KeithTaylor?q=tag%3AChange" target="_blank">Change</a> - denotes changes I plan to make.</li>
<li><a href="https://hypothes.is/users/KeithTaylor?q=tag%3Aediting" target="_blank">editing</a> - means that I've saved the note that I'm currently working on. Or that I've forgotten to delete my <code>editing</code> tag! I use this to avoid losing text as I'm writing it, as Hypothes.is does not have autosave. Though there are ways round that.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="shrewdsubjectsgroups">ðŸ—ƒShrewdSubjects Groups</h3>
<p>Though I like to BuildInPublic, I also like to collaborate. Now, collaboration is possible using public annotation. But I'm trying to create services built around teams. So I've created private groups for each ðŸ—ƒShrewdSubject.</p>
<p>Currently, joining these private Hypothes.is groups starts by subscribing to one or more newsletters:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://keithctaylor.gumroad.com/l/sijmd?wanted=true&amp;price=0" target="_blank">Foodary Nexus Newsletter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://keithctaylor.gumroad.com/l/rqmqt?wanted=true&amp;price=0" target="_blank">GoutPal Links Newsletter</a></li>
<li>Shrewd Learning Newsletter</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="myprivatewebannotationgroup">My Private Web Annotation Group</h3>
<p>I try to do most of my content creation in public. Or in teams. So I only currently have one group for private notes. But Hypothes.is allows you to create as many private groups as you need. Which is useful where you want to keep notes separate. However, I recommend using tags unless you are sure you want separate groups of notes.</p>
