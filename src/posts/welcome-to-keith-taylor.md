Welcome to Keith Taylor's Internet Content.

I've published this website to help you arrange routine activities and small project tasks more efficiently.

<h2 id="history">Keith Taylor's Internet Content History</h2>

The best way to see how my personal blog has developed is to browse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210211055442/https://keith.1drous.me/">Keith Taylor's Internet Content in The Wayback Machine</a>.

<h2 id="status">Keith-Taylor.Pages.Dev Status</h2>

Currently, I am replacing keith.1drous.me on WordPress with the Eleventy Jamstack platform. I refer to this process as `WordPress transmigration`. Because I want to differentiate it from `WordPress migration`. As that normally refers to moving a WordPress installation from one server to another.

<h2 id="intent">Keith-Taylor.Pages.Dev Intentions</h2>

My intentions for this site are:
- Complete the 'Admin' pages that will form the defaults for all my websites.
- Post updates about my other website changes as often as I can.

One of my first projects will be a new website that will explain how to transmigrate a WordPress website. But prior to that I will create a template that can be used for new websites based on what I have learned so far about Jamstack sites.

My first priority now is to complete switching from my WordPress server. Then I the will continue transmigration with new and revised content using Jamstack.

Please note that I don't intend to transfer any articles from my old blog. But if you want an update on something in the archive (linked above), let me know using the 'Issues' link below.

<h2 id="next">Your Next Steps</h2>

If you are familiar with RSS, this website does have a live feed that you can follow now. But I will explain that more as I complete the 'About Keith-Taylor.Pages.Dev' pages.

Finally, I hope you will comment on, and start your own, <a href="https://github.com/kct2020/keith-taylor-11ta/issues">Keith Taylor's Internet Content Issues</a>. Because that's the best way to encourage me to put your concerns at the top of my ToDo List.
